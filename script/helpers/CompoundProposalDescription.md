# Compound Governance Upgrade: TimelockMultiAdminShim Implementation

## Overview
This proposal implements the `TimelockMultiAdminShim` contract to enhance Compound's governance system with improved flexibility, security, and support for multiple executors.

## What This Proposal Does

- **Sets `TimelockMultiAdminShim` as pending owner** of the `CompoundTimelock`
- **Updates the `CompoundGovernor`** to use `TimelockMultiAdminShim` as its timelock
- **Enables multi-executor support** while preserving governance delay guarantees

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Security**: Multiple authorized executors with strict access control
- **Improved Flexibility**: Admin is mutable but only via timelock-controlled proposals
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserves existing Governor + Timelock interface and behavior
- **Audited Design**: Based on OpenZeppelin's well-tested contract patterns

## Technical Details

The `TimelockMultiAdminShim` acts as a proxy layer that:
- Forwards all queued operations to the underlying `CompoundTimelock`
- Adds support for **multiple executors** beyond just the admin
- Enables the **admin address to be updated**, but only through the timelock itself
- Maintains compatibility with the standard `ICompoundTimelock` interface

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: The core timelock logic is unchanged; shim is a routing layer
- **Audited Components**: Built on OpenZeppelin's audited timelock and governance contracts
- **Fully Tested**: Invariant-tested and verified against existing Compound assumptions

## Next Steps

1. `CompoundTimelock` accepts `TimelockMultiAdminShim` as the new admin (pending â†’ accepted)
2. `CompoundGovernor` begins using the shim for all future proposal scheduling
3. Additional executors (like `RollbackManagerTimelockCompound`) can be added via future proposals

---

*This proposal strengthens the Compound governance system with minimal risk and high flexibility. All changes are permissioned, auditable, and respect the existing timelock delay.*
